    "Think about it - you're asking a computer, which has NO idea what you're talking about or how to identify anything in any way other than how you tell it to identify things, to look at something completely new and categorize it. If you feed it 1000 emails, 950 of which are 'not spam' and 50 of which are 'spam,' and ask it to identify which are 'not spam,' it can just label everything as 'not spam' and be 95% correct! Not bad!\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet... that doesn't do what you want at all. You want your model to learn the characteristics of 'spam' emails and actually identify the parts of it which are reliable predictors for 'spam' in general, something the computer is increasingly incentivized not to do as the majority in your datasets gets larger compared to the minority. If your target is really imbalanced, your model will have to work increasingly harder in order to do better than the model-less baseline of just predicting the majority class."

    "\n",
    "The **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** conducts cluster-based over-sampling. SMOTE works by finding all the instances of the minority category within the observations, drawing lines between those instances, and then creating new observations along those lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SMOTE visualized](images/SMOTE_R_visualisation_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Image source is a great explainer on SMOTE (but uses R for the examples): https://rikunert.com/SMOTE_explained\n",
    "\n",
    "This is better than simply using a random over-sample, yet not only are these synthetic samples not real data but also these samples are based on your existing minority. So, those new, synthetic samples can still result in over-fitting, since they're made from our original minority category. An additional pitfall you might run into is if one of your minority category is an outlier - you'll have new data that creates synthetic data based on the line between that outlier and another point in your minority, and maybe that new synthetic data point is also an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to create synthetic data to over-sample our minority category is the **Adaptive Synthetic approach, ADASYN**. ADASYN works similarly to SMOTE, but it focuses on the points in the minority cluster which are the closest to the majority cluster, aka the ones that are most likely to be confused, and focuses on those. It tries to help out your model by focusing on where it might get confused, where 'spam' and 'not spam' are the closest, and making more data in your 'spam' minority category there.\n",
