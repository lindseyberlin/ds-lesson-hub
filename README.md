# Data Science Lesson Resources

This repository acts as a central hub of all of my personal resources to teach Flatiron School's Online Data Science Curriculum V2. 

I will likely be adapting content created by other Flatiron School instructors, repurposing other repos and notebooks, and collecting whatever other resources I find, then pushing them here to assemble all of my changes made for the purpose of teaching the curriculum to online students.

For more information or with questions about the curriculum, ask [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/).
